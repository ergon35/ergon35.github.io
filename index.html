								<h2 class="major">IoT and Cyber Security</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>IoT, or the Internet of Things, refers to the network of physical devices, vehicles, appliances, and other objects embedded with sensors, software,
									 and connectivity capabilities. These devices can collect and exchange data over the internet, enabling them to interact with each other and
									  with their users.

									</p>
								<p>Cybersecurity, on the other hand, is the practice of protecting computers, servers, networks, and data from unauthorized access, damage, theft, or any other form of cyber-threat. 
									It involves implementing measures to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems, as well as mitigating risks associated with cyberattacks.<br>
									When it comes to IoT, cybersecurity becomes a critical concern due to the interconnected nature of devices and the potential vulnerabilities they may possess.
									 IoT devices often have limited computational resources, weak security configurations, and lack of regular software updates, making them attractive targets for cybercriminals.
									  Furthermore, the vast amount of data generated by IoT devices can be sensitive and valuable, requiring robust security measures to protect it.

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>On this page, I will provide information about my work and also share pictures as an example.</p>
								<br><h3>Kali Linux</h3>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/linux.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>We will use kali linux while doing these studies. I will briefly talk about kali linux.</p>
                                <p>Kali Linux is a powerful and widely used Linux-based operating system specifically designed for security professionals,
									 penetration testers, and ethical hackers. It is developed and maintained by Offensive Security and is known for its vast collection of pre-installed security tools.
									 With over 600 included tools, Kali Linux offers a robust and comprehensive platform for various security-related tasks, including network scanning,
									 vulnerability assessment, digital forensics, password cracking, wireless attacks, web application testing, and much more.
									 Its flexibility, regular updates, and active community support make it a popular choice for individuals and organizations seeking a 
									 reliable and feature-rich environment for security testing and assessment.</p>
									 <br>

								<h3>Activity 1 - Scanning Activity</h3>

							

                              <p>Scanning activity in IoT refers to the process of actively searching for and identifying IoT devices within a network or a specific range of IP addresses.
								 It involves sending probes or requests to various IP addresses and analyzing the responses received to determine the presence and characteristics of IoT devices.
								 Scanning is commonly used in the field of cybersecurity to identify vulnerabilities, gather information about network topology, or assess the security posture of systems.</p>
								
								<br>
								<p><b>How many hops from your machine to your assigned website?</b></p>
								<p>There can typically be anything from 5 to 20 hops on any website request.
									 While the process for running each test is the same, the method of starting them slightly differs across Operating Systems.</p>
									 <p>What are the main nameservers for the website?</p>
									 <p>Every web site has two name servers –ns1 and ns2 to which domain is pointed. They are set by the web host on the purchase of a domain name and a web hosting account.
										 Ns1 is the first server listed as the primary server, while the second one-Ns2 is used as a backup server, if, the first server is not responding.<br><br>
										 What is the MX record for the website?<br><br>
										 The MX record for the domain "youtube.com" is MX record: aspmx.l.google.com<br>
										 YouTube uses the email services provided by Google. The MX record "aspmx.l.google.com" indicates that the mail server responsible for handling email for the
										  "youtube.com" domain is hosted by Google. The priority of 1 indicates that it is the highest priority MX record for email routing.
										</p>
										<p>Where is the website hosted? </p>
										<p>YouTube, being one of the largest video-sharing platforms globally, has a vast infrastructure distributed across multiple data centers around the world.
											 These data centers are strategically located to ensure efficient content delivery and reduce latency for users in different regions.<br>
											 However, the exact details of YouTube's hosting infrastructure, including the specific locations of their data centers, are not publicly disclosed.
											  YouTube is operated by Google, which has a vast network of data centers worldwide.<br>
											  Google has data centers located in various regions, including North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. 
											  The content hosted on YouTube is likely spread across these data centers to provide optimal performance and redundancy.</p>
								

								<h3>Activity 2 - Honeypot</h3>

								<p>A honeypot is a security mechanism or tool used to detect, deflect, or study unauthorized access attempts or malicious activity on a network or system.
									It is essentially a decoy or trap designed to lure potential attackers, allowing security professionals to observe and analyze their tactics, techniques, and intentions.
									The concept of a honeypot involves creating a system or network resource that appears to be a legitimate target, enticing attackers to interact with it.
									However, this resource is isolated and closely monitored, minimizing the risk of compromising
									the actual production environment. Honeypots can be deployed both internally within an organization's network or externally on the internet.
									<br>
									There is a example whit pictures what we do in the lab session.<br>
									Here's what we did on Kali linux:<br><br>

									
									From the left sidebar,click the Terminal icon to open its window.
									<p>In the terminal window execute the fallowing command : ifconfig</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/lux2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/lux3.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In the Terminal window execute the fallowing commands to manage the directory.<br>
									1- cd-pentbox-1.8<br>
									2- ./pentbox.rb<br>
									(Note:Execute one command at a time.) </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/lux4.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In the Terminal window, when asked to select the  Network tools option, type 2 and press the Enter key.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/lux5.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In the Terminal window when asked to select the Honeypot option, type 3 and press the Enter key.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/lux6.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In the Terminal window, type 443 and  press the Enter key to open the port. <br>
								Type the false message as Caught You!! and press the Enter key.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/lux1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In the Terminal window type y and press the Enter key to save the log.<br>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/lux7.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
                                  Press the Enter key to save the log file in the default location.<br>
								  In the Terminal window type n and press the Enter key for not activating the beep sound.<br>
								  Open Firefox ESR, and in the address bar, type https://<ip address> and press Enter. <br>
									You will see that the Problem loading page tab appears that says Secure Connection Failed.<br>
									Go back to the Terminal window; you will see INTRUSION ATTEMPT DETECTED.Press Ctrl+C to stop.<br>
									Close all windows.

									<h3>Activity 3 - DDOS ATTACK</h3>

									<p>A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a network,
										 service, or website by overwhelming it with a flood of incoming traffic or requests.
										 In a DDoS attack, the attacker typically harnesses a large number of compromised computers or devices
										  (often forming a botnet) to simultaneously send a high volume of traffic to the target,
										   rendering it unable to handle legitimate requests. </p>

										   <span class="image main"><img src="images/ddos.jpg" alt="" /></span>
										   <span class="image main"><img src="images/howork.jpeg" alt="" /></span>

								<p>Protecting against DDoS attacks requires proactive planning, network resilience,
									 and the ability to respond effectively when an attack occurs.
									 Organizations often work with their internet service providers (ISPs) and
									 DDoS mitigation specialists to implement appropriate defense mechanisms and strategies to mitigate the impact of DDoS attacks. </p>
									 <span class="image main"><img src="images/how-to-stop-ddos-attacks.png" alt="" /></span>
									 <p>What type of programs or software can we use for protection?<br>
									    1-DDoS Protection Services<br>
									    2-Firewalls<br>
									    3-Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)<br>
									    4-Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)<br>
									    5-Load Balancers<br>
									    6-Anti-DDoS Routers<br>
									    7-Traffic Monitoring and Analysis Tools</p>
										<p>How to perform SYN flooding Attack with Metasploit?</p>
										<span class="image main"><img src="images/syn.png" alt="" /></span>
										<p>CP SYN flood is a type of Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that
											exploits part of the normal TCP three-way handshake to consume
											resources on the targeted server and render it unresponsive.</p>
											<p>How to perform SYS Flood with Metasploit<br>
												First, select your target’s IP address. I am
                                           taking testphp.vulnweb.com as a victim. So you know how to get
                                             an IP address from a domain name. Simple doping and that will give to domain IP address.
											 <span class="image main"><img src="images/perform1.png" alt="" /></span>
											 <p>So now I know the victim’s IP Address 18.192.182.30. <br>
												Launching Metasploit by typing msfconsole in your kali terminal</p>
												<span class="image main"><img src="images/metas.png" alt="" /></span>
												<p>Then use the select the auxiliary “auxiliary/dos/TCP/synflood” by
													typing the following command.<br>
													<b>Msf6 > use auxiliary/dos/tcp/synflood</b><br>
													<b>Msf6> show options</b>
													</p>
													<span class="image main"><img src="images/meta2.png" alt="" /></span>
													<p>Now you can see you have all the available options that you can set.
														<br>To set an option just you have to typeset and the option name and
														option.
														<br>
														You have to set two main option<br>
														RHOST= target IP Address<br>
														RPORT=target PORT Address<br>
														<b>Set RPORT 18.192.182.30</b><br>
														<b>Set RPORT 80</b><br>
														To launch the attack just type.<br>
														<b>exploit

														<h3>Activity 4 - Digitalisation</h3>

														<p>What is digitalization?
														<br>Digitalization is the process of incorporating digital technologies into various aspects of life and business to transform analog processes into digital formats,
														 improving efficiency, connectivity, and access to information.	
														</p>
														
														<span class="image main"><img src="images/digi.png" alt="" /></span>
														<p>What are the security implications of the digital economy?</p>

														<p>The digital economy has revolutionized the way we conduct business and interact with technology. 
														While it offers numerous advantages, it also introduces several security implications that need to be considered.<br>
														Some key security implications of the digital economy:<br>
														1-Cyberattacks<br>
														2-Data Privacy<br>
                                                        3-Identity Theft and Fraud<br>
														4-Internet of Things (IoT) Security<br>
														5-Cloud Security<br>

														<p>What is a 'fully digital enterprise' ? </p>
														<p>By embracing digital transformation, organizations can unlock new opportunities,
														increase competitiveness, and better meet the changing needs of customers in the digital age.</p>
														<p>What are the cyber Security challenges/concerns with a fully digital enterprise? </p>
														<p>One of the primary cyber security challenges with a fully digital enterprise is the increased risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
														The organization becomes a target for cybercriminals seeking to exploit vulnerabilities in interconnected systems and gain unauthorized access 
														to sensitive data. Data breaches can result in financial losses, reputational damage, legal liabilities, and loss of customer trust. 
														Preventive measures, such as implementing robust security protocols, access controls, and encryption, as well as conducting regular security assessments
														 and employee training, are essential to mitigate this risk.</p><br>

														 <p>What are the cyber security challenges for a bricks and mortar SME wanting to become a digital enterprise?</p>

														 <p>A common cyber security challenge for a bricks and mortar SME transitioning into a digital enterprise is the lack of expertise and resources dedicated to cybersecurity.
															SMEs may not have the knowledge or financial capacity to effectively address potential cyber threats
															and vulnerabilities. This makes them more vulnerable to attacks and data breaches. 
															To mitigate this challenge, SMEs should consider seeking external assistance, such as partnering with managed
															security service providers or cybersecurity consultants, to strengthen their security posture and ensure adequate protection of their digital assets.
														 </p>
														 <p>Do you agree with the views expressed, especially in light of the 'energy crisis' experienced worldwide in 2022</p>

														 <span class="image main"><img src="images/gas.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
														 <p>I think that the biggest reason for the energy crisis in 2022 is the war between Ukraine and Russia. With the start of the war, other countries in the world started to take sides.
														In this case, certain economic embargoes were brought along. 
														Russia restricted gas sales for a certain period of time.
														 In this case, it greatly affected European countries that bought 43 percent of their gas from Russia.<br><br>
